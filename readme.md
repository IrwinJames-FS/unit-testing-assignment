# Unit test assignment
This is a review of the video and unit test assignments.

### Obscure
The obscure method just uses the length of the string to determine if the card number is a valid length then subtracts 4 from said length and creates a string of Xs of the length and then slices the last 4 from the provided card number on concats the two together.

### Total
I did change total to use a spread of all the arguments. this changes the syntax from total([...]) to total(...) or total(...array); 

### gencard
This was just for fun. because each credit card number complies with luhns algorithm. I decided I would implement a generator that would generate potentially valid card numbers. I also exported each method used in the generator methods.
